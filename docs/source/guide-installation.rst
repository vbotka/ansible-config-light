The most convenient way how to install an Ansible role is to use
Ansible Galaxy CLI ``ansible-galaxy``. The utility comes with the
standard Ansible package and provides the user with a simple interface
to the Ansible Galaxy's services. For example, take a look at the
current status of the role ::

    shell> ansible-galaxy info vbotka.config_light

and install it ::

    shell> ansible-galaxy install vbotka.config_light

.. seealso:: * To install specific versions from various sources see `Installing content <https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/using/installing.html>`_
	     * Take a look at other roles ``shell> ansible-galaxy search --author=vbotka``
