Playbook
========

Below is a simple playbook that calls this role (10) at a single host srv.example.com (2)

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 2,10
   :linenos:

   shell> cat config-light.yml
   - hosts: srv.example.com
     gather_facts: true
     connection: ssh
     remote_user: admin
     become: yes
     become_user: root
     become_method: sudo
     roles:
       - vbotka.config_light

.. note:: ``gather_facts: true`` (3) must be set to gather facts needed to evaluate OS-specific
          options of the role. For example to install packages the variable *ansible_os_family* is
          needed to select the appropriate Ansible module.
